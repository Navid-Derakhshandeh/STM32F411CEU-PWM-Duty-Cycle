I’ve developed codes to generate triangular duty cycles using digital pulses triggered by a tactile button connected to pin PA0. The STM32F411CEU produces PWM pulses and transmits data via USART TX (PA9), which is received by an FTDI serial to USB converter. The data is then captured by a C# Windows Forms application I Developed, which displays the duty cycles on a panel.
